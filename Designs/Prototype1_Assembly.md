# Prototype 1 Assembly

##Questions to answer

**Q**: What diameter influent and effluent tubing will the subteam use?
**A**: Tentatively, the subteam will use clear tubing that is 3/16" in diameter. What kind of tubing is this?

**Q**: How will the subteam direct hot water into the reactor?
**A**:

**Q**: How will the subteam use ProCoDa to run experiments?
**A**:

**Q**: How will the reactor be mounted?
**A**: The reactor will be mounted with clamps on a vertically adjustable metal arm, as provided by the Filter Constrictions Subteam from Spring 2018.

## Reactor
The 1 inch diameter PVC pipe that the subteam is using for the reactor is labeled with the following:
1. (Orange) Subteam member names and NetIDs
2.  (Red) Top / Effluent end
3. (White) Bottom / Influent end
4.   (Pink) Prototype 1

**Figure 1**: The photograph above is of the Prototype 1 reactor, empty, labeled with team members' names and with the appropriate influent(white)-effluent(red) tape labels. The reactor will be secured to the 80 20 with four metal hose clamps. The height of the reactor above the table is **TBD**.

## Tubing
The subteam acquired 3/16 diameter clear flex tubing for the influent and effluent tubing.
| | Saint Gobain part number | Inner Diameter | Outer diameter | Wall thickness | Minimum bend radius | Max working pressure at 73F | Max working pressure at 160F |
|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| TYGON SE 200 tubing | AJD00012 | 3/16" | 5/16" | 1/16" | 1 1/2" | 75 psi | 38 psi |

Barbed fittings will be placed on each end of the tubes to connect the tubing to the reactor.
