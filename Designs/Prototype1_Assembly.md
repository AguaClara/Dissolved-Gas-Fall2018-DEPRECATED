# Prototype 1 Assembly

##Questions to answer

**Q**: What diameter influent and effluent tubing will the subteam use?
**A**: Tentatively, the subteam will use clear tubing that is 3/16" in diameter. What kind of tubing is this?

**Q**: How will the subteam direct hot water into the reactor?
**A**:

**Q**: How will the subteam use ProCoDa to run experimentvs?
**A**:

**Q**: How will the reactor be mounted?
**A**: The reactor will be mounted with clamps on a vertically adjustable metal arm, as provided by the Filter Constrictions Subteam from Spring 2018.

## Reactor
The 1 inch diameter PVC pipe that the subteam is using for the reactor is labeled with the following:
1. (Orange) Subteam name, member names and NetIDs
2. (Red) Top / Effluent end
3. (White) Bottom / Influent end
4. (Pink) Prototype 1

**Figure 1**: The photograph above is of the Prototype 1 reactor labeled with team members' names and with the appropriate influent (white) and effluent (red) tape labels. The reactor will be secured to a vertically adjustable metal arm, constructed with 80 20, with four metal hose clamps. The height of the reactor above the table is 221cm.
The Prototype 1 reactor contains a 70 mL Silica sand bed (indicated with a green circle in the figure), measured with a graduated cylinder. The 70 mL volume was decided arbitrarily. Dividing that volume of sand by the cross-sectional area of the reactor, which we determined to be 4.811 cm$^2$ (shown in our reactor measurements file), resulting in the height of the sand bed being approximately 15 cm.

## Tubing
The subteam is using 3/8" clear flex tubing to carry water from the sink to the peristaltic pump. 1/8" Masterflex tubing (06508-16) fits in the peristaltic pump, and it is connected to the sink tubing using a medium "push to connect" connector. On the other side of the peristaltic pump, the tubing is connected to the influent tubing for the reactor.

The subteam acquired 3/16 diameter clear flex tubing for the influent and effluent tubing for the reactor.

| | Saint Gobain part number | Inner Diameter | Outer diameter | Wall thickness | Minimum bend radius | Max working pressure at 73F | Max working pressure at 160F |
|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| TYGON SE 200 tubing | AJD00012 | 3/16" | 5/16" | 1/16" | 1 1/2" | 75 psi | 38 psi |

Effluent tubing is measured to have a length of approximately 240cm. The distance between the top of the reactor and the table is 221cm, and more length was added in case the height of the reactor needs to be increased. The tubing was secured to a light so that the minimum bend radius was greater than 1.5".
