# Prototype 1 Calculating Effluent Head Loss

The following inputs were used to calculate the head loss of the first prototype reactor:

Dynamic viscosity of water at 23 degrees Celsius: 0.9321 mPa.s
Length of effluent tubing: 2.67m
Velocity of water: 14.3 cm/s
- For this, we used the velocity corresponding to the fluidization flow rate of 2.54mL per second, and the effluent tubing's inner diameter of (3/16").

Using these inputs and the code HeadLoss.py, the subteam calculated an effluent head loss of 0.0506 m.
