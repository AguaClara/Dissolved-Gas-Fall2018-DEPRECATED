## Prototype 1 Test 1

The subteam assembled the whole apparatus, Prototype 1, as shown in Figure 1. The subteam directed non-supersaturated water into the reactor, ensuring that the system does not leak, and filling the reactor with water.

In order to fluidize the sand bed, the peristaltic pump must be set to approximately 150 milliliters per minute (this is a simple calculation based off the results in the Prototype1_Reactor_Measurements file). The subteam found that our current peristaltic pump has approximately 80mL/min capacity; the subteam will acquire the necessary pump in the near future.

Note that during actual experiments, the flow rate of the water will be carefully noted for the sake of scientific integrity.

**Figure 1**: Shown at left is a photograph of the Prototype 1 apparatus; shown at right is the photograph with enhancement to clarify the system's progression.
Influent water (purple arrow) enters the system through the peristaltic pump (orange rectangle), flows up into the reactor (green rectangle), exits the as effluent water (red arrow) and pours into a small bucket (yellow rectangle).

**Figure 2**: Shown at left is a photograph of the sink from which water was drawn into the system; shown at right is the photograph with enhancement to clarify the system's progression.
The sink supplies influent water (purple arrow), which enters the system through tubing, and is directed into the peristaltic pump as shown in Figure 1.
