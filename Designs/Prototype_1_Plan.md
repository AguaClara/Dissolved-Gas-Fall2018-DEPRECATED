## Prototype 1 Design Parameters

![Fluidized Bed Design](https://github.com/AguaClara/Dissolved-Gas/blob/master/Images/Fluidized%20Bed%20Design.jpg)

#### Constants
$\rho_{sand} = 1905 kg/m^3$
- The above value is an average, found in Source 5 in the Fluidization page in the Literature folder

$\rho_{water} = 997 kg/m^3$

Kinematic viscosity (?)
Limitations of the peristaltic pump (?)

#### Parameters
\* = chosen arbitrarily
\** = measured
\*** = calculated
\* Height of reactor: $h_r =$ 0.5m
\* Height of sand bed: $h_s =$ .125m $=$ 125mm
