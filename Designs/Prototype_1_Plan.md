### General plan
In order to fabricate a viable prototype, the subteam must determine the appropriate fluidization velocity to suspend the sand in the reactor.

The fluidization velocity of the sand is dependent on: the sand's density; the kinematic viscosity of water; the reactor's cross section area; the height of the sand bed; the porosity of the sand bed. The subteam will use the formula from Fluidization Source 4 to calculate fluidization velocity.

After determining the appropriate fluidization velocity, and taking into account the limitations of the peristaltic pump, the subteam may begin fabrication.

### Constants relevant to calculations
**Sand Density**
$\rho_{sand} = 1905 kg/m^3$
The above value is an average, found in Source 5 in the Fluidization page in the Literature folder

**Water Density**
The density of water: $\rho_{water} = 997 kg/m^3$

**Water's Kinematic viscosity**
Water's kinematic viscosity of water is dependent on the temperature.

At 23 degrees Celsius (room temperature):

$v= 0.9344 mm^2/s$

Value found in Source 7 in the Fluidization page in the Literature folder

**Limitations of the peristaltic pump**
The pump is capable of 1 to 100 rpm, but it is best to keep it below 67 rpm for accuracy.

### Parameters
