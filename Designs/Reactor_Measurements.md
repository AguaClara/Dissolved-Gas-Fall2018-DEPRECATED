## Reactor Measurements
### Pipe dimensions
The subteam is considering the use of a clear, colorless, plastic pipe as the body of the prototype reactor. The measured dimensions of the full-length pipe are given  below. Measurements were taken using a caliper, in units of millimeters. Measurements were taken at both ends of the pipe.

#### Side 1
| Measurement | Thickness of Pipe | Outer Diameter | Calculated Inner Diameter | Calculated Inner Cross Sectional Area (mm^2) |
|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| 1 | 3.96 | 33.39 | 25.47 | 509.5 |
| 2 | 3.99 | 33.32 | 25.34 | 504.3 |
| 3 | 4.16 | 33.38 | 25.06 | 493.2 |
| Average | 4.04 | 33.36 | 25.29 | 502.3 |

#### Side 2
| Measurement | Thickness of Pipe | Outer Diameter | Calculated Inner Diameter | Calculated Inner Cross Sectional Area (mm^2) |
|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| 1 | 4.08 | 33.30 | 25.14 | 496.4 |
| 2 | 4.40 | 33.30 | 24.50 | 471.4 |
| 3 | 4.05 | 33.39 | 25.29 | 502.3 |
| Average | 4.18 | 33.33 | 24.98 | 490.1 |

The percent difference between the calculated, inner, cross-sectional area of the pipe at either end is **2.459%**. The subteam believes this is an acceptable percent difference for the pipe to be a usable component for the prototype.

The overall average cross-sectional area of the pipe is 496.2mm^2, with a standard deviation of **to be inserted later**.
