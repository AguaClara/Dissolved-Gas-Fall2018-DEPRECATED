## Reactor Measurements
### Pipe dimensions
The subteam is considering the use of a clear, colorless, plastic pipe as the body of the prototype reactor. The measured dimensions of the full-length pipe are given  below. Measurements were taken using a caliper, in units of millimeters. Measurements were taken at both ends of the pipe.

This pipe may not be used for the actual reactor, but the data will be kept.

#### Side 1
| Measurement | Thickness of Pipe | Outer Diameter | Calculated Inner Diameter | Calculated Inner Cross Sectional Area (mm^2) |
|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| 1 | 3.96 | 33.39 | 25.47 | 509.5 |
| 2 | 3.99 | 33.32 | 25.34 | 504.3 |
| 3 | 4.16 | 33.38 | 25.06 | 493.2 |
| Average | 4.04 | 33.36 | 25.29 | 502.3 |

#### Side 2
| Measurement | Thickness of Pipe | Outer Diameter | Calculated Inner Diameter | Calculated Inner Cross Sectional Area (mm^2) |
|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| 1 | 4.08 | 33.30 | 25.14 | 496.4 |
| 2 | 4.40 | 33.30 | 24.50 | 471.4 |
| 3 | 4.05 | 33.39 | 25.29 | 502.3 |
| Average | 4.18 | 33.33 | 24.98 | 490.1 |

The percent difference between the calculated, inner, cross-sectional area of the pipe at either end is **2.459%**. The subteam believes this is an acceptable percent difference for the pipe to be a usable component for the prototype.

The overall average cross-sectional area of the pipe is 496.2mm^2, with a standard deviation of 13.44mm^2.

###Sand grain dimensions
The following measurements were made using a caliper; the sand is Silica sand, and the ten sand grains are taken to be a representative sample of the sand used in the reactor.

The average measured diameter of the sand grains is 0.91mm, with a standard deviation of 0.21mm. This was calculated using the StandardDeviation.py code. 

| Sand grain | Measurement 1 (mm)| Measurement 2 (mm) | Measurement 3 (mm)|
|:----------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|
|1           |0.69           |0.84           |1.08           |
|2           |1.33           |0.85           |1.31           |
|3           |1.13           |1.32           |0.90           |
|4           |1.20           |1.17           |0.86           |
|5           |0.98           |0.79           |0.77           |
|6           |0.71           |0.73           |0.72           |
|7           |1.00           |0.78           |0.82           |
|8           |0.76           |0.92           |0.70           |
|9           |0.69           |0.70           |0.76           |
|10          |0.91           |0.74           |1.10           |
