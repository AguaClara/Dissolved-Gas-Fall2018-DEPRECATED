# Pre-test Prototype 1

Using the same values as in Prototype 1 Plan, assuming a sand grain diameter of 1mm, the subteam hand-calculated a fluidization velocity of 5.6mm/s. This was done through the formula in Fluidization Source 4. With an average cross sectional area of 496.2mm^2 (see Reactor_Measurements.md), the fluidization flow rate is 2.8 mL/s. This seems to be a very reasonable value for operating the prototype.

Using the code, FluidizationVelocity_ALternative.py, the following value was calculated for the flow rate of the fluidization flow rate through the reactor: 2.8 mL/s. These values agree!
