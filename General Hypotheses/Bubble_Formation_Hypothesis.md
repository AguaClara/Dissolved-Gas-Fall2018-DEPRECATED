### Maximizing Bubble Formation

One of the subteam's objectives is to maximize bubble formation in the bed reactor. Bubble formation is affected by the following:
- Pressure
  The subteam wants to minimize pressure to maximize bubble formation.
  - Constructing the sand bed at an optimal altitude will minimize pressure
  - Pressure on a bubble is a function of the bubble's diameter (greater diameter, smaller pressure)
      - Bubble diameter may be affected by the size of the particles, porosity of the sand bed, the height or diameter of the fluidized bed, or flow rate

- Flow Rate
  An increased flow rate also increases bubble volume.
