# Pressure within a bubble

The hypothesis in this file is an in-progress attempt to connect information drawn from the various sources in the Literature folder. Hopefully, the various relationships and equations concerning pressure, surface tension, reactor height, and gas solubility will unify into one cohesive relationship of properties.

For the sake of brevity, all mentioned sources are found in the Literature folder. Sources are cited in the following format: <Page> <Source>, e.g. "Surface Tension Source 2".

According to Surface Tension Source 1, the pressure within a bubble is directly related to the pressure outside the bubble, plus a quotient determined by the liquid's surface tension and the bubble's radius.

The subteam considers that the pressure outside of the bubble, the pressure within the liquid, may be determined by the atmospheric pressure plus a change in pressure due to the height of the reactor due to a reference point (in this case, the reference point is the vent for the bubbles, downstream from the reactor). Pressure changes due to height are addressed in Ambient Pressure and Gas Solubility Source 4. 

The subteam considers that the pressure relevant to Henry's Law is the pressure within the bubble; the lower the pressure within the bubble, the lower the solubility of the gas in the surrounding solution. This is addressed in Ambient Pressure and Gas Solubility Source 1.

The subteam believes that the equations relating these quantities may be combined to form one cohesive equation. This equation gives the solubility of the gas in solution as a function of a bubble's radius, the height of the reactor, surface tension, and the constant relevant to Henry's Law.

This theory may act as an approximation of the pressure within the bubbles.
