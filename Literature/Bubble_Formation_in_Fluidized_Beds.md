## Source 1: Bubble Growth and Rise in Soft Sediments
#### Citation
Boudreau, Bernard P., et al. “Bubble Growth and Rise in Soft Sediments.” GeoScienceWorld, 5 June 2005, https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article/33/6/517/103815/bubble-growth-and-rise-in-soft-sediments.
#### Quotations
“The mechanics of uncemented soft sediments during bubble growth are not widely
understood and no rheological model has found wide acceptance.”
“The sand appears to be displaced spherically and thus to behave like a fluid or an elastic-plastic solid in response to the stress created by the bubble.”
#### Summary of Information
Bubbles in soft, sandy sediments grow spherically showing that sand acts fluidly in response to growth stresses __clarify__. Sand is displaced __clarify__ by the bubble, which is why it would be good to use in our reactor. Bubbles in muddy substances and gelatin are more disk-shaped because they form from fractures in the sediment.
This article is more about bubble formation and rise in muddy, soft sediments that fragment under stress, but it does have brief descriptions of the behavior of bubble formation in sand.
#### Application to Research
Bubble formation is a crucial part of the method we want to use to remove dissolved gas from influent water.  By creating a fluidized bed reactor using sand, we will be able to create spherical bubbles that rise up and out of the system.  Sand will be a useful medium for this experiment as opposed to mud, gelatin, or other soft sediments because it acts fluidly when under the stress of a bubble rising.

#### Summary of Information
The surface of a fluidized bed has an effect on the volume of a bubble, and its relationship is shown by the formula:
$$ \frac{D_{bm}-D_b}{D_{bm}-D_{bo}} = e^{\frac{-kh}{D_t}}$$ 
$ D_{bm} =$ max diameter of bubble
$D_b =$ diameter of bubble
$D_{bo} =$ diameter of bubble at start
$D_t =$ diameter of bed
$h =$ height above distributor plate
$k =$ constant tbd by data (.30 in this experiment)
#### Application to Research
We want the bubbles formed in our fluidized reactor to have a large enough diameter such that their buoyancy allows them to float to the top of the water.  In this article, the graphs show that as bubbles rise to the surface, their diameters become larger.  Seeing that the diameter of the fluidized bed reactor does have an effect on the size of the bubbles formed, we can use this information to find the maximum bubble size.

Harrison, D., and L. S. Leung. “Bubble Formation at an Orifice in a Fluidized Bed | Nature.” Nature | International Journal of Science, 29 Apr. 1961, https://www.nature.com/articles/190433a0.
#### Summary of Information
The relationship between flow and bubble volume is as shown:
$$V = 1.378\frac{G^{1.2}}{g^{0.6}}$$
$V =$ bubble volume
$G =$ gas flow
$g =$ acceleration due to gravity
Note: formula inaccurate for flows greater than 10mL/sec
#### Application to Research
Bubble formation and size can be fairly accurately predicted for gas-solid fluidized beds using the given formula.

#### Citation
Schulz, Piotr. Instability and the Formation of Bubbles and the Plugs in Fluidized Beds. Vol. 24, no. 1, 2004, p. 27.
#### Quotations
“In most liquid-fluidized beds, … although instability is present and can be seen in the form of wavy structures this does not lead rapidly to bubble formation.”\
“This behaviour (bubbles) can also occur in liquid-fluidized beds when the ratio of the density of the solid to that of the liquid is high (e.g. lead shot fluidized with water).”\
“Linear stability theory indicates only qualitative differences between gas- and liquid-fluidized beds, both growth rates and speeds of propagation being much larger in the former.”
#### Summary of Information
Bubble formation is less predictable in liquid-fluidized beds than in gas-fluidized beds. There are two common types of issues that come up during liquid-fluidized bed experiments:\
1. Large bubbles with same diameter as fluidized bed rise slowly and displace particles\
2. Slowly rising bands __clarify__ of particle deficient regions and rapid particle rain (common in tubes up to 4-5cm).
#### Application to Research
If we have problems forming bubbles in our fluidized bed of sand and water, it could be because of the density ratio of sand to water. We may want to consider using a solid material with a higher density if we find that bubble formation is not present in the sand/water fluidized bed. In addition, if we run into a problem with bands of fluid low and high in particle density __clarify__, we may want to consider using a tube with a larger diameter (>5cm).
