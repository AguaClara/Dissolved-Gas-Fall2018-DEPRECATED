#### Useful information

You can find the porosity of soil by measuring the amount of water it takes to fill all of the pores in the soil.

1. Transfer a sample to a graduated beaker to measure the volume. Record this volume exactly.
This measurement is the $V_{sample}$

2. Measure out a generous amount of water into a graduated cylinder. Start with more water than you will need. Record this volume exactly.

3. Saturate the sample with the water. Get the water as close as you can to the exact top of the sample in the beaker, but don't go over the top.

4. Subtract the volume of water that you used up from the starting volume in the graduated cylinder. That shows you how much water it took to saturate the soil. The volume of the water used is equal to the Pore Volume $V_{pore}$

5. You find "Total Volume" by adding $V_{sample}+V_{pore}$

6. Lastly, you can use the formula to find porosity:

$$\phi = \frac{V_{pore}}{V_{pore}+V_{sample}}$$
