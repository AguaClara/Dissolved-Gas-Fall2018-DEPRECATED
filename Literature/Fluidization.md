#### Useful Formulas
$$ \epsilon=\frac{V_t-V_p}{V_t} $$
$$ \epsilon=1-\frac{m}{\rho_p A H} $$
$\rho_p =$ density of particles

- The subteam will likely be using Silica sand, which has a density of approximately 2650 kg/m^3.  


$m =$ the total mass of the particles in the bed
$A =$ the cross sectional area of the tube
$H =$ the height of the bed
$\epsilon =$ the porosity of the bed (aka. the bed voidage)
$V_t =$ total volume of the bed $= AH$
$V_p =$ total volume of particles within the fluidized bed $= AH(1-\epsilon)$

This source contains information relating to the minimum fluidization velocity required to fluidized a bed of particles. We will use this information to determine the minimum velocity of influent water in order to fluidize the sand bed in our fluidized bed reactor.

#### Useful Formulas

$$ g(\rho_s-\rho)=\frac{1.75 \rho u^2}{d \epsilon^3}+ \frac{150 \mu (1-\epsilon)u}{d^2 \epsilon^2} $$

$\rho_s =$ catalyst density
$\rho =$ fluid density
$u =$ fluid velocity
$d =$ particle diameter
$\epsilon =$ void space of the bed (Warning: this is *not* equal to the bed voidage, despite the sources using equivalent symbols)
$\mu =$ fluid viscosity
$g =$ acceleration due to gravity

#### Summary of Information

Determined that $U_{mf}$ (minimum fluidization velocty) is increased when the sand density of size is increased.

#### Useful Formulas
$$ V_{minfl}= \frac{\phi^3 g D^2}{36kv(1-\phi)}(\frac{\rho_s}{\rho_w}-1) $$

$V_{minfl} =$ minimum approach velocity required to fluidize the sand bed
$\phi =$ porosity, $\frac{Volume Of Voids}{Total Volume} = 0.4$ for uniform size media (Note: porosity and voidage are, in this case, equal quantities)
$g =$ acceleration due to gravity
$D^2 =$ diameter of the sand grain, squared
$k =$ Kozeny constant, approximately equal to 5 for most filtration conditions
$\rho_w =$ density of water
$\rho_s =$ density of sand particles
$v =$ kinematic viscosity

$\rho_{SilicaSand} = 2650 kg/m^3$

#### Useful information

The diameter of a grain of sand can vary from 0.05mm up to 2 mm, with the average size of .2mm. Sand particles between 0.05mm and 0.2mm in diameter are considered fine sand, and grains of sand with a diameter from .2mm to 2mm are considered coarse.
