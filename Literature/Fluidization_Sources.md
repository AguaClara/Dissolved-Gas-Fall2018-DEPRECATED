#### Useful Formulas
$$ \epsilon=\frac{V_t-V_p}{V_t} $$
$$ \epsilon=1-\frac{m}{\rho_p A H} $$
$\rho_p =$ density of particles
$V_t = AH$
$V_t =$ total volume of the bed
$V_p = AH(1-\epsilon)$
$V_p =$ total volume of particles within the fluidized bed
$A =$ the cross sectional area of the tube
$H =$ the height of the bed
