###Maximizing Bubble Formation

Our objective is to maximize bubble formation in the bed reactor. Bubble formation is affected by the following:
- Pressure
  We want to minimize pressure to maximize bubble formation.
  - We can minimize pressure of the bubbles by building the sand bed at an optimal altitude
  - Pressure on a bubble is a function of the bubble's diameter (greater diameter, smaller pressure)
      - We must learn how to maximize bubble diameter; bubble diameter may be affected by the size of the particles, porosity of the sand bed, the height or diameter of the fluidized bed, or flow rate

- Flow Rate
  It seems that an increased flow rate also increases bubble volume.
