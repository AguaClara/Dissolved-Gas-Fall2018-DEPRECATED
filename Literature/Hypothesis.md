Our objective is to maximize bubble formation in the bed reactor. Bubble formation is affected by the following:

1.Pressure: We want to minimize pressure to maximize bubble formation.
-We can minimize pressure of the bubbles by building the sand bed at the maximum altitude
-Pressure on a bubble is a function of the bubble's diameter (greater diameter, smaller pressure)
//*TODO (Figure out how to maximize bubble diameters)- Might have to do with size of sand particles, porosity of sand bed,
height/diameter of fluidized bed, flow rate

2.Flow Rate - It seems that an increased flow rate also increases bubble volume.
