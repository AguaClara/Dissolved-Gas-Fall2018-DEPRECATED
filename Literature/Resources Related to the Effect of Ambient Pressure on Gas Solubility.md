#### Summary of Information
Solubility of a gas in a solution increases in accord with its partial pressure above said solution.\
\
When a gas comes into contact with a liquid, some of its molecules dissolve into the liquid. Once the dissolved gas’ concentration increases such that the gas’ rate of dissolving equals the rate at which gas escapes solution, equilibrium is established.\
\
When one increases the pressure of a gas, one increases the number of molecules per unit volume; this increases the rate at which molecules collide with the liquid’s surface and dissolve into it. Eventually, a new equilibrium is established, with a greater amount of gas dissolved into the liquid. Given this information, the converse is true; as the partial pressure of a gas decreases, so does the gas’ solubility.\
\
An example of this phenomenon is as follows. A carbonated drink is bottled [under CO2] with a partial pressure greater than 1 atm. When the bottle is opened, the ambient pressure immediately drops, the dissolved gas’ solubility decreases, and the dissolved gas escapes from the drink as bubbles.\
Henry’s Law describes the relationship between pressure & a gas’ solubility:\
C = kP, ∆C = k∆P\
Where:\
C = dissolved gas's concentration at equilibrium [mol/L]\
P = dissolved gas's partial pressure\
k = Henry's Law constant, which is determined experimentally for each combination of gas, solvent, and temperature\
Gases that react with water don’t obey Henry’s law; they’re more soluble than predicted by the law.
#### Application to Research
The fluidized bed reactor will be raised above the input of water; therefore, the ambient pressure of the fluidized bed will be lower than that of the influent water. This should decrease the solubility of the dissolved gases. The amount of pressure change is determined by the change in height, as shown in the following equation:\
∆P = ⍴g∆h\
In conjunction with the nucleation sites present in the fluidized bed, this will encourage bubbles to form, and to leave the influent water.
