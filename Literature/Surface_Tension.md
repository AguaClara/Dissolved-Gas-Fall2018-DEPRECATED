#### Summary of Information
$$P_i = P_o + 4 \frac{T}{R}

$P_i =$ the pressure within the bubble
$P_o =$ the pressure outside of the bubble
$T =$ the surface tension of the liquid in which the bubble resides
$R =$ the radius of the bubble

#### Summary of Information
Surface tension is a constant property for a given substance at a given temperature.


### How does the information from these sources relate to the subteam's research as a whole?
Surface tension is a constant, for a given liquid at a given temperature. Given the equation above, one can therefore determine the pressure within a bubble by knowing the pressure outside the bubble, knowing the liquid's surface tension, and knowing the bubble's radius.

Through maximizing the radius of the bubble, the pressure within the bubble is minimized, and the gas in the liquid reaches minimum solubility, according to Henry's Law.

Further research and experimentation will be required to determine how the subteam can maximize the radius of gas bubbles that form in the reactor.
