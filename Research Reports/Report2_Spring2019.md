## Abstract
Briefly summarize your previous work, goals and objectives, what you have accomplished, and future work. (100 words max)

## Introduction
Explain how the completion of your challenge will affect AguaClara and the mission of providing safe drinking water (or sustainable wastewater treatment!). If this is a continuing team, how will your contribution build upon previous research? What needs to be further discovered or defined? If this is a new team, what prompted the inclusion of this team?

## Literature Review and Previous Work
Discuss what is already known about your research area based on both external work and that of past AguaClara Teams. Connect your objectives with what is already known and explain what additional contribution you intend to make. Make sure to add APA formatted in-text citations. If you mention the author(s) in your sentence, you can simply give the year of publication.[(Logan et. al. 1987)](http://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/25043431.pdf?acceptTC=true)


## Methods
Explain the techniques you have used to acquire additional data and insights. Reserve fine detail for the Manual at the end of the report, but use this section to give an overview with enough detail for the reader to understand your Results and Analysis. Describe your apparatus, and have a justification for every decision you made and every parameter you chose in the design of the apparatus. Be especially careful to detail the conditions your experiments were conducted under, as this information is especially important for interpreting your results

Below, some example sections are given. Sectioning the report is meant to keep similar information together.  Continue making sections as necessary, or delete sections if you do not need them. Feel free to add subsubsections to further delineate the information. For example, under the Experimental Apparatus section below, the EStaRS team might consider having sections such as "Filter Design" and "Filter Fabrication".

### Experimental Apparatus
Explain your apparatus setup using enough detail such that future teams can recreate your apparatus. Make sure to explain why you built it this way.
* Design (calculations, constraints)

  $\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$
* Schematic (label parts)

  <img src="https://github.com/jillianwhiting/Jillian-Whiting/blob/master/Images/IMG_0009.jpg?raw=true" height=250 width=200>

* Image (from lab; label parts)
* Materials (dimensions, materials)
* Complications in construction
* If already constructed: write a brief summary of important constraints, include any revisions to apparatus, also reference the prior report where construction is described

### Procedure
Discuss your experimental procedure. How did you run your experiment? What were you testing? What were the values of relevant parameters?

## Results and Analysis
Present an observation (results), then explain what happened (analysis).  Each paragraph should focus on one aspect of your results. In that same paragraph, you should interpret that result.  
In other words, there should not be two distinct paragraphs, but instead one paragraph containing one result and the interpretation and analysis of this result. Here are some guiding questions for results and analysis:

When describing your results, present your data, using the guidelines below:
* What happened? What did you find?
* Show your experimental data in a professional way.
```python
from aide_design.play import*
x = np.array([1,2,3,4,5])
y = np.array([1,2,3,4,5])
plt.figure('ax',(10,8))
plt.plot(x,y,'*')
plt.savefig('/Users/jillianwhiting/github/Jillian-Whiting/Images/linear')
plt.show()
```
![linear](https://github.com/jillianwhiting/Jillian-Whiting/blob/master/Images/linear.png?raw=true)
Figure 1: Captions are very important for figures. Captions go below figures.

After describing a particular result, within a paragraph, go on to connect your work to fundamental physics/chemistry/statics/fluid mechanics, or whatever field is appropriate. Analyze your results and compare with theoretical expectations; or, if you have not yet done the experiments, describe your expectations based on established knowledge. Include implications of your results. How will your results influence the design of AguaClara plants? If possible provide clear recommendations for design changes that should be adopted. Show your experimental data in a professional way using the following guidelines:
* Why did you get those results/data?
* Did these results line up with expectations?
* What went wrong?
* If the data do not support your hypothesis, is there another hypothesis that describes your new data?

## Conclusions
Explain what you have learned and how that influences your next steps. Why does what you discovered matter to AguaClara?

Make sure that you defend your conclusions with facts and results.

## Future Work
Describe your plan of action for the next several weeks of research. Detail the next steps for this team. How can AguaClara use what you discovered for future projects? Your suggestions for challenges for future teams are most welcome. Should research in this area continue?

## Manual

This manual lays out the details of the materials and methods used for the aforementioned experiments and fabrication.

### Experimental Methods

#### Determining the Porosity of Silica Sand

The porosity of silica sand was needed to calculate the sand bed's fluidization velocity ([Equation 1](#Equation-1)). The following procedure was used to determine the porosity of the silica sand used in the reactor, based on the procedure outlined by [Worth, 2018](https://socratic.org/questions/how-do-scientists-measure-the-porosity-of-soil). The equation for determining porosity may be verified by dimensional analysis in comparison with the equation found in the source: [Department of Chemical Engineering, 2017](http://ww2.che.ufl.edu/unit-ops-lab/experiments/FB/FB-manual.pdf).

**Set-Up**
1. Acquire silica sand, water, and two graduated cylinders.
2. Transfer a portion of the sand to a graduated cylinder and record the sand bed’s volume. This is the “sample volume”, $V_{sample}$.
3. Pour an excess volume of water into a second graduated cylinder. Record this volume.

**Experiment**
1. Pour water from its graduated cylinder into the graduated cylinder containing sand until the meniscus’ peak is level with that of the sand bed. This equates to saturating the sand with water.
2. Record the volume of water remaining in its respective graduated cylinder. Subtract this volume from the initial volume of water present in the graduated cylinder; the difference is the volume of water used to saturate the sand. This quantity is the "pore volume", $V_{pore}$.
3. Repeat the Set-Up and Experimental Steps 1-2  until three trials’ worth of data has been recorded.
4. Use [Equation 8](#Equation-8) to calculate the sand’s average porosity ($\phi$).

$$\phi = \frac{V_{pore}}{V_{sample}}$$


#### Determining the Average Diameter of Silica Sand Grains

The average diameter of the silica sand grains was needed to calculate the sand bed’s fluidization velocity ([Equation 1](#Equation-1)). The subteam used the following procedure to approximate the average diameter of the sand grains.

1. Acquire a sample of silica sand and a digital caliper.
2. Randomly select a number of sand grains, preferably greater than or equal to ten, from the sample.
3. Using the caliper, measure each sand grain’s diameter three times to account for the grains’ asymmetrical natures. Record these measurements.
4. Compute the average diameter for all sand grains in the sample.

#### Measuring Pipe Dimensions

The prototype fluidized bed reactor was comprised of a transparent PVC pipe containing a silica sand bed, modified with components specified in the Fabrication Manual.

**Set-Up**
The subteam cut the pipe to be a particular length prior to taking measurements.
1. Acquire a transparent PVC pipe of approximately 1” diameter, a Sawzall reciprocating saw, colored tape in two shades, permanent markers, measuring tape, and a caliper.
2. Use a measuring tape and marker to indicate a length of 0.5 m on the PVC pipe. Cut the PVC pipe using the Sawzall such that it matches this length.
3. Wrap tape of opposing colors on opposing ends of the pipe, but *leave several inches between the edge of the pipe and the tape itself*. The tape should be several inches from the edge of the pipe. Use this tape to maintain awareness of the pipe's orientation.

**Measurement**
1. Use a caliper to take the following measurements on both opposite ends of the pipe:
- Measure the thickness of the pipe’s wall in three locations. Compute the average thickness of the pipe’s wall.
- Measure the diameter of the pipe (including the wall) in three locations. These measurements are of the pipe’s “outer diameter”. Compute the average outer diameter of the pipe.
- Subtract twice the wall’s thickness from the outer diameter; the difference is the “inner diameter”. Use this quantity to calculate the cross-sectional area of the pipe.
2. Compute the average cross-sectional area of the pipe, using the measurements taken at both ends.

### Fabrication Manual

**Materials required**
1. PVC pipe of approximately 0.5 m length, whose ends are labeled with opposing colors of tape, as shown in Figure 8. This is described further in the Measuring Pipe Dimensions section of the Manual.
2. A fine wire mesh
3. Approximately 70 mL of silica sand, measured with a graduated cylinder.
4. Circular clamps
5. 3/16-inch diameter clear flex tubing
6. 3/8-inch diameter clear flex tubing
7. 1/8-inch Masterflex tubing (06508-16)
8. Peristaltic pump
9. Barbed fittings & push-to-connect components
10. Access to a sink containing a push-to-connect nozzle
11. A plastic bucket
12. Two copies of the following pipe-tubing connector component:

<p style="text-align: center;">
<img src="https://github.com/AguaClara/Dissolved-Gas/blob/master/Images/Prototype_1/PipeConnector1.jpg?raw=true" height=250
</p>

Recall **Figure 7** from the Methods section. The above flow connector enables the reactor (pipe) to be connected to clear flex tubing.

**Fabrication**
1. Cut the wire mesh to obtain a circular mesh whose radius is approximately that of the pipe.
2. Place the mesh at the bottom of the pipe reactor, at the side designated for influent to enter the pipe. Place this mesh into the flow component that from (11).
3. Pour the 70 mL of sand into the pipe, such that it halts on the mesh.
4. Fasten the second copy of the flow component from (11) to the effluent (top) end of the reactor.
5. Mount the pipe on the 80/20 arm using circular clamps, screwed tight around the reactor.
6. Connect 1/8-inch Masterflex tubing (06508-16) to the Peristaltic Pump.
7. Connect 3/8-inch diameter clear flex tubing from the sink to the influent end of the Peristaltic Pump.
8. Connect 3/16-inch diameter clear flex tubing from the effluent end of the peristaltic pump to the influent end of the reactor.
9. Cut approximately 2.4 m of 3/16-inch diameter clear flex tubing. Connect this to the effluent (upper) end of the reactor, and lead it down into the bucket.

### Python Code

#### Determining the Sand Bed's Fluidization Flow

The subteam used the following code, copied from the file FluidizationVelocity.py found on the subteam's GitHub page, to estimate the fluidization velocity and fluidization flow of the sand bed in the prototype reactor. The code is based on [Equation 1](#Equation-1). The code requests as input: the reactor's cross-sectional area; the kinematic viscosity of water at a particular temperature (e.g. room temperature); the sand's porosity, which the subteam experimentally determined; silica sand's density; the average diameter of the sand grains, which the subteam measured. The code outputs the velocity and flow of water required to fluidize the sand bed.

The following values were used for the subteam to calculate the fluidization flow of 2.54 mL/s:

Cross-sectional area of the reactor: 481.1 mm$^2$
Porosity of the silica sand: 0.35
Density of silica sand: 2650 kg/m$^3$ [(Weber-Shirk)](https://courses.cit.cornell.edu/cee4540/pdf/Filtration.pdf)
Average diameter of the silica sand grains: 0.91 mm
Kinematic viscosity of water: 0.9344 mm$^2$/s [(Anton Paar)](https://wiki.anton-paar.com/en/water/)

```python
# This code assumes the user knows the porosity of the sand used in the fluidized bed. This code makes use of aide_design, a package provided by AguaClara Cornell

# Assumptions: All input values are real numbers.

import math
import numpy as nm
import aide_design as ad
from aide_design import utility as ut
from aide_design.play import*

area_reactor = float(input("\nWhat is the cross-sectional area of the fluidized bed reactor, in units of millimeters squared?\n"))*u.mm**2
porosity = float(input("What is the porosity of the sand bed?\n"))

density_sand = float(input("What is the density of the sand, in units of kilograms per cubic meter?\n"))*u.kg/(u.m**3)
density_water = 997*u.kg/(u.m**3)

diameter = float(input("What is the average diameter of the sand grains, in units of millimeters?\n")) * u.mm


g = 9.8 *u.m/(u.s**2)
kozeny = 5
viscosity = float(input("What is the kinematic viscosity of water, in units of millimeters squared per second?\n"))*u.mm**2/u.s

fluidization_velocity_FirstTerm = (porosity**3 * g * (diameter)**2)/(36*kozeny*(viscosity)*(1-porosity))

fluidization_velocity_SecondTerm = (density_sand/density_water - 1)

fluidization_velocity = fluidization_velocity_FirstTerm * fluidization_velocity_SecondTerm * (1000*u.mm)/(1*u.m)

fluidization_flow = fluidization_velocity * area_reactor * (0.001*u.mL)/(1*u.mm**3)

print("\nThe reactor's fluidization velocity is "+ str(ut.sig(fluidization_velocity,3))+".")
print("The reactor's fluidization flow is "+ str(ut.sig(fluidization_flow,3))+".")
```

#### Calculating Averages and Standard Deviations

The following code, copied from the file StandardDeviation.py found on the subteam's GitHub page, outputs the average value and the standard deviation of a group of input values.

```python
import math
import numpy as nm
import aide_design as ad
from aide_design import utility as ut
from aide_design.play import*

print("\n"+"Please input only real numbers; make sure the list is at least two items long! If you're done inputting your list, just type 'done'."+"\n")
values = []
item = "blank"
for n in range(100):
    item = input("What number would you like to add to the list?" +"\n")
    if item == "done":
        break
    else:
        try:
            values.append(float(item))
        except:
            print("It seems like you didn't input a number. Please try again!")

total=0
for n in range(len(values)):
    total += values[n]

average= total / len(values)

numerator = 0
for n in range(len(values)):
    numerator += (values[n]-average)**2

standard_deviation = math.sqrt(numerator / (len(values)-1))

print("The list you've entered has an average value of " + str(ut.sig(average, 4)) +", with a standard deviation of "+ str(ut.sig(standard_deviation, 4))+'.')
```

#### Determining Head Loss in the Effluent Tubing

This code follows [Equation 4](#Equation-4), and may be found on the subteam's GitHub page. It outputs the head loss in tubing containing a laminar flow, and requests as input: the absolute viscosity of water; the tubing length, the water's velocity, the and the pipe's diameter.

```python

import math
import numpy as nm
import aide_design as ad
from aide_design import utility as ut
from aide_design.play import*

viscosity = float(input("What is the dynamic (i.e. absolute) viscosity of water, in units of millipascal seconds?\n"))*(1/1000) * u.kg/u.m/u.s
effluent_tubing_length = float(input("What is the length of the effluent tubing, in units of meters?\n"))*u.m
velocity = float(input("What is the velocity of water in the effluent piping, in units of meters per second?\n"))*u.m/u.s

density_water = 997*u.kg/(u.m**3)
g = 9.8 *u.m/(u.s**2)
pipe_diameter = float(input("What is the diameter of the effluent piping, in units of meters?\n"))*u.m

Head_Loss = (32 * viscosity * effluent_tubing_length * velocity)/(density_water * g * pipe_diameter**2)

print("The Head Loss due to the effluent tubing is "+ str(ut.sig(Head_Loss,3))+".")
```

### ProCoDa Code

The following code allows the Dissolved Gas subteam to turn on the peristaltic pump at a desired speed.

#### States
- *OFF*: The system (peristaltic pump) is off.
- *Running*: The peristaltic pump is running.


#### Set Points
- *OFF*: This setpoint is used to turns all outputs off.
- *ON*: This setpoint turns on the peristaltic pump on.
- *PumpOutput*: This setpoint is used to turn on the peristaltic pump at the correct number of RPMs to achieve the desired flow rate, given the Tubing ID.


#### Variables
- *FlowRate*: This variable is the desired flow rate. In the subteam's reactor, this represents the fluidization velocity.
- *TubingID*: This variable represents the ID associated with tubing being used, based on the diameter of the tubing.
