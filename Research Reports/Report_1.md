## Abstract
Excess dissolved air in a water treatment plant’s influent water decreases functionality of the treatment plants’ filters and sedimentation tanks. The Dissolved Gas subteam begins its first semester with the goal to design a gravity-powered apparatus that extracts this gas from influent water prior to entry into the treatment plant. The subteam will gather literature, develop designs, fabricate a small-scale prototype, and iterate improvements based on experimental data to work towards a model that may be scaled up for application in an AguaClara plant.

## Introduction
Excess dissolved gas in influent water in AguaClara plants at Tamara, Honduras and EL PODA, Nicaragua has inhibited the plants' efficiencies. Excess gas causes bubbles to form in the sedimentation tank, causing flocs that should settle to rise and continue into the remainder of the plant. In the sand filter, gas bubbles form between sand particles and effectively clog the filter [(Scardina, 2004)](https://vtechworks.lib.vt.edu/bitstream/handle/10919/26497/PaoloScardinaDissertation2004.pdf?sequence=1). To remedy this, the Dissolved Gas subteam intends to design a reactor that removes such dissolved gas from influent water prior to entering the plant, in order to preserve the efficiency of the water treatment process.

To clarify, “excess dissolved gas” does not entail bubbles being present in influent water. Gas is supersaturated in the influent water: the molecules are dispersed throughout the water, not congregated in bubbles. Bubbles form in the sedimentation tank and in the sand filter, within the plant itself, due to the presence of this excess gas. For this reason, the subteam plans to remove the excess gas through the use of a reactor stationed prior to the plant.

For the sake of efficiency, the term “supersaturated water” will be used in this report to reference water containing excess dissolved gas, whether air or otherwise.

The current conception of the overall system design is as follows: influent water will flow from its source at a high elevation. Once the influent water has descended from its source and is near to the AguaClara plant, piping will direct this influent water upwards into a reactor. Atmospheric pressure decreases with height; according to Henry’s Law, gas becomes less soluble at lower pressures, making bubble formation more likely. Aspects of the reactor will further encourage bubble formation (a.k.a nucleation) in the reactor. The water, now containing gas bubbles, will flow upward out of the reactor. Piping will direct the water downward into a basin containing a vent where gaseous bubbles may exit the water. The water, no longer supersaturated, then flows into the treatment plant. Figure 1 illustrates this design.

**Figure 1**: The above diagram depicts (not to scale) the general design of the system to remove excess dissolved gas from influent water, as the above paragraph describes.

The subteam currently considers two main options for the design of the reactor itself: a fluidized bed reactor, and a vertical plate reactor. As of yet, the subteam has focused its research on the fluidized bed reactor. While technical details are more thoroughly discussed in the Literature Review section, the main attributes of the two options are as follows.

A fluidized bed reactor consists of an enclosed reactor containing a suspension of particles, such as sand, in a liquid; they are kept in suspension by a particular flow rate directed upwards. This flow is that of the influent supersaturated water, entering the reactor from the bottom and flowing upwards toward an exit pipe. The suspended particles provide surfaces on which bubbles can form. The bubbles then rise from the reactor, leaving the sand particles behind. Figure 2 illustrates this design.

**Figure 2**: The above diagram depicts (not to scale) the general concept of a fluidized bed reactor using sand particles, as the above paragraph describes.

A vertical plate reactor consists of an enclosed reactor containing a series of parallel, vertically aligned, textured plates. Supersaturated water enters the bottom of the reactor and flows upward along the plates to reach the exit pipe. The texturization of the plates provides sites for bubbles to form while the water flows. In theory, after reaching a specific critical diameter, these bubbles detach from the plates and flow upwards as effluent. Figure 3 illustrates this design.

**Figure 3**: The above diagram depicts (not to scale) the general concept of a vertical plate reactor as the above paragraph describes. The plates, depicted by brown lines, extend outward in the plane of the page.

The subteam considers that the vertical plate reactor design has the potential benefit of keeping bubbles stationary while they grow and accumulate. In the case of a fluidized bed reactor, bubbles may immediately travel upward once they form, since their formation site is mobile. They may depart the fluid at a smaller size, carrying a high internal pressure, and being likely to rupture and disperse into solution.

The subteam intends to first design and fabricate a prototype fluidized bed reactor, and to evaluate its feasibility as a solution. The subteam will consider the vertical plate reactor at a later time in the semester and will weigh the merits of both designs.

## Literature Review
According to ____________, pressure at __________ height changes in ____ way. According to _______, the size of a bubble indicates the pressure in __________ way. Taken together, this means that we want to maximize bubble diameter and maximize the height of the reactor, within reason (talk about Henry's Law)

Etc.
Mention Henry’s Law
NEED: Source about bubble pressure vs diameter
Catalyzing bubble growth
Venting the bubbles
When in doubt, say: “For details on this topic, see the Literature Review section.
