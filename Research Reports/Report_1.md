## Abstract
Excess dissolved air in a treatment plant’s influent water decreases functionality of the treatment plants’ filters and sedimentation tanks. The Dissolved Gas subteam begins its first semester with the goal to design a gravity-powered apparatus that extracts this gas from influent water prior to entry into the treatment plant. The subteam will gather literature, develop designs, fabricate a small-scale prototype, and iterate improvements based on experimental data to work towards a model that may be scaled up for application in an AguaClara plant.

## Introduction
Excess gas in AguaClara plants at Tamara, Honduras and EL PODA, Nicaragua has damaged the plants' efficiencies. Excess gas has causes bubbles to form in the sedimentation tank, causing flocs that should settle to rise and continue into the remainder of the system. In the sand filter, bubbles form between sand particles and effectively clog the filter. To remedy this, the Dissolved Gas subteam intends to design a reactor that removes such dissolved gas from influent water prior to the plant itself, in order to preserve the efficiency of the water treatment process.

To clarify: excess dissolved gas does not entail bubbles. Particles of air are distributed throughout the influent water; they form bubbles in the sedimentation tank and the sand filter. The subteam plans to remove the dissolved gas through the use of a reactor; the subteam is currently considering two main options, with greater consideration toward the first: a fluidized bed reactor, and a vertical plate reactor.

The overall system design is currently thought to be as follows. Influent water will flow from a source at a high elevation. This influent water, containing excess dissolved gas, prior to entrance into the AguaClara plant, will be directed (the flow will be directed) upwards into a reactor, whose attributes will instigate the formation of bubbles.

According to Henry's Law, gas becomes less soluble at lower pressures, thus making the formation of bubbles more likely. Bubble formation will be further encouraged by the composition of the reactor itself. Figure 1 shows the general premise of the apparatus' design, without specifying the design of the reactor itself.

While technical details are discussed in the Literature Review section, the main attributes of these two options are as follows.

A fluidized bed reactor consists of an enclosed space containing a suspension of particles, such as sand; they are kept in suspension by a carefully chosen flow rate directed upwards. These particles provide surfaces on which bubbles can form; the bubbles will then rise from the reactor, and leave the sand particles behind. Figure 2 displays this design.

A vertical plate reactor would consist of an enclosed space containing a series of parallel, vertically aligned, textured plates. The texture/indentation of said plates would provide sites for bubbles to form. After reaching a critical size, in theory, these bubbles would then depart from the plate and flow upwards into the effluent. Figure 3 displays this design.

The subteam intends to first design and fabricate a prototype fluidized bed reactor, and to evaluate its feasibility as a solution. The vertical plate reactor will be considered at a later time, and the pros and cons as to each design will be evaluated.

Tentatively, the subteam considers that the vertical plate reactor has the potential benefit of keeping bubbles stationary while they grow. In the case of the fluidized sand reactor, bubbles may immediately travel upward along with the sand particle, departing the fluid at a relatively small size, carrying a high internal pressure, and being likely to redisperse into solution.
